Net::CLI::Interact::Manual::Phrasebook - List of Supported CLIs

=head1 INTRODUCTION

The bundled phrasebook includes support for a variety of network device CLIs.
Many were contributed by users of the module, so if you too set up a new CLI
dictionary, please do contribute it back.

For each supported CLI, there is a name which must be passed in the
C<personality> option to L<Net::CLI::Interact>'s C<new()> method. After that,
you can call the included Macros, and the module will use the included Prompt
to match the current state of the CLI. More information is available in the
L<Tutorial|Net::CLI::Interact::Manual::Tutorial> and
L<Cookbook|Net::CLI::Interact::Manual::Cookbook>.

the avilable Prompts, Macros and Continuations, and from which other CLI
dictionaries it inherits.
